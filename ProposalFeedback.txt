Project Proposal Feedback
Project: Drift AI
=========================
Proposal Document [2 points]:
   Verbal Description:
      You provide a clear high-level concept and you explain that Drift AI
         is an application that uses conversational AI to simulate
         professional scenarios which helps users improve speech and social
         interaction skills.  This satisfies the requirement to state what
         the project does at a high level.
      You describe low-pressure practice for social/professional moments
         feedback through transcript + tone analysis.  This conveys the
         problem being solved and the general mechanism.
      You list students seeking internships/jobs, new employees, people who
         struggle with reading social cues, and international individuals
         learning professional English nuances.  This directly satisfies
         "Who are the intended users?"
      This meets or exceeds the description requirements.

   Justification:
      You demonstrate a strong personal justification when you explain that
         you have a passion for AI and mobile development, you have had
         personal experiences that inspire the project, and you want to help
         others in similar situations.  This aligns with the requirement to
         state why this project is appropriate for you.
      Further, you identify your existing skills and the new skills you want
         to learn, which is extremely relevant to the course's goal that you
         grow through technical challenge.

VIDEO EVALUATION
================
Nice presentation!  This is a very interesting and useful project, with a
strong social component.  I look forward to seeing how it comes out and also
seeing how others respond to it.

A couple of things on your presentation slides though.  There are a couple
of slides that contain LOOOOOONG paragraphs of text.  It is better to have a
set of bullets with just some small text so that the reader isn't distracted
from what you are -saying- by having to -read- all that text.  Next time,
try putting in bullets and condensing the paragraphs to a few short items.

Another thing I noticed is on the title slide your name is misspelled.  You
should make sure to spell check!  ...and I mean every time.

You do seem to have the idea of the nuts and bolts of your project, but you
seem to be working from a script or from written notes.  You should try to
give your presentation from your 'head' knowledge and just talk about it.

Yes, English is a weird language!  That's why this will be a good project.

Nice job overall.  You earn back Four out of Five points for this deliverable.
