Software Requirements Specification
Initial Development Schedule
CMSI 4072 Spring 2026
=======================================

COMPONENT BREAKDOWN:
   Strengths
      Identifies major system parts and their roles.
      Mentions external service interaction via internet..pdf)
   Suggestions
      No hierarchical structure of components.
      No explanation of communication flows between modules.
      Missing data models, API contracts, and module responsibilities.

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
   Strengths
      Covers all major functionality areas.
      User stories illustrate expected tasks in detail.
      Includes specific features: scenario descriptions, feedback scoring,
         history tracking..pdf)
   Suggestions
      No error-handling cases (e.g., lost internet, failed scoring API).
      No accessibility or UI consistency rules.
      No constraints on data integrity or local caching.
      Specify data storage constraints, retention, and permissions.

PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS:
   Strengths
      Clear measurable thresholds (5 seconds load, <1 second latency,
         1 minute feedback).
      Addresses responsiveness for critical features such as live
         conversation.
   Suggestions
      Add resource usage limits (CPU, memory, battery).
      Provide performance expectations under weak network conditions.
      Add thresholds for background processes and history loading.

ENVIRONMENT REQUIREMENTS:
   Strengths
      Lists hardware and software for development and deployment clearly.
      Includes device, OS, microphone, and network needs.
      Covers both Android and iOS environments.
   Suggestions
      No mention of required permissions (microphone access is implied but
      not specified formally).
      No specification of storage or bandwidth needs beyond minimal values.
      No description of compatibility across screen sizes or device classes.

OVERALL ASSESSMENT:
   Category                          Points
   Component Breakdown               0.8/1
   Functional Requirements           3.6/4
   Performance Requirements          2.0/2
   Environment Requirements          1.0/1
                                     =====
   Subtotal                          7.4/8
   Preliminary Schedule              2.0/2
   ------------------------------------------------------
   Total Percentage:   9.4/10 = 94% which is an A

You've met most of the desired measurements for this deliverable.  The
functional requirements section provides clear user facing functionalities
across UI, scenario selection, conversation handling, feedback, and
progress tracking.  User stories outline expected behaviors.  Your SRS
is very well done but could benefit from at least incorporating a few of
the suggestions to make it even more complete, such as: adding a structured
component hierarchy with diagrams; and defining interfaces and data
exchanged between subsystems.

Nice work on this deliverable ~ keep up the good work!
