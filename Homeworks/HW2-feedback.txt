=================
SPECIFIC COMMENTS:

Problem 5.1 ~ Correct core idea: components are in the same program, SOA
   services run independently.  Minor inaccuracies: component-based systems
   do not normally communicate across a network; components communicate
   inside the process. But the contrast with SOA is broadly correct.

Problem 5.2 ~ Reasoning for monolithic: acceptable and consistent with
   simple device-based apps.  Reasoning for event-driven: correct for
   input-driven interactions.  However, the justification lacks mention of
   alternatives and constraints, and oversimplifies architecture selection.

Problem 5.4 ~ correct

Problem 5.6 ~ correct

Problem 5.8 ~ correct

Problem 6.1 ~ correct

Problem 6.2 ~ correct


=================
nice work!
